We've launched "E-Key," a revolutionary mobile keyboard app aiming to enhance digital communication security. Addressing privacy and security concerns in our interconnected world, our motivation is to safeguard user conversations from unauthorized access and privacy breaches. "E-Key" offers real-time text encryption, ensuring confidentiality and user-friendliness. The project's objectives encompass seamless integration, efficient decryption, user privacy, cross-platform compatibility, and ongoing security updates. We also outline the organized project structure, covering literature review, methodology, testing, and future recommendations, providing a comprehensive understanding of how "E-Key" will transform digital communication, making it more private and secure.
